Assume you had access to an AI model that can generate small-scale cities on an isometric grid by creating individual tiles.
For each of these tiles (identified by their 2D position), a short but expressive text prompt has to be provided.
Additionally, a global prompt is used, which provides context, lighting, time of day, as well as the art style.
The prompts of the tiles can be generic but they might have a semantic connection to neighbouring tiles (such that a river can flow through the city on multiple tiles).
The format for the instructions to the AI model is JSON.
Consider the following example:

{
    "tiles":
        [
            { "prompt": "ancient stone bridge over a stream", "x": 0, "y": 0 },
            { "prompt": "lively stream past mossy banks", "x": 1, "y": 0 },
            { "prompt": "serene pond reflecting moonlight", "x": 0, "y": 1 },
            { "prompt": "bustling medieval market street", "x": 1, "y": 1 }
        ],
    "prompt": "{tile_prompt}, medieval setting, isometric view, glowing lanterns, soft shading, vibrant colors, detailed textures"
}

The art style and perspective mentioned in the prompt should be maintained. The rest may be freely adapted.
There are no limits to the setting, the sky is your limit.
Now, please generate a 3 x 3 grid.
